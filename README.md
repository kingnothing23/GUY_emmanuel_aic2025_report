Appendix for the report  for the aic2025 course

can be finded in the design folder :
- the designs in xschem
- the layouts in magic
- The symbols files for xschem
- the .md files ( i dont know what they do)
   -JNW_GR01 is the whole circuit 
   - NANd_V2 is the nand gate
   - NOT_GATE  is  the  not gate
   - SKYOP  is  the op amp
   - SKY_OTA is the  OTA
   - temo_effected_current is the analog circuit
   - temo_effected_current_ref_vb is as  slighlty different version of the analog circuit
   - testbench is the testbench for analog circuit
   - D_FLIP_FLOP_V2 is the D Flip_Flop


I included the simulations folders for the simulated designs in the sim_files folder
In the work folder  i included everything related to the designs that was  in my work folder, just in case.
