# GUY EMMANUEL AIC2025 Project – Appendix

This repository serves as the appendix for the report submitted as part of the AIC2025 course.

## Repository Structure

Inside the project folder, you will find the following:

- `xschem/` – Schematics for the designs
- `magic/` – Layouts for the designs
- `symbols/` – Symbol files for use in xschem
- `.md` files – Notes or documentation files (exact purpose may vary)
- `sim_files/` – Contains simulation setups and outputs for the designed circuits
- `work/` – Backup of all files from the development environment, included for reference
- `pictures/` – Contains all images used in the report and some additional ones

## Circuit Blocks Included
